# schaeffler-diagram
Generate Schaeffler Diagrams for Stainless Steel Alloys Welding, based on the composition of the base metal and the electrodes.

## _A tool to generate Schaeffler Diagrams for Stainless Steel Alloys Welding_
[![Python 3.10](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

The Schaeffler Diagram is used in Metalurgical and Mechanical Engineering to predict the final composition of the welded region of a stainless steel welding.

This information is very important as based on the region and therefore on the phase of the welded zone (or thermally affected zone), some problems could appear on the final product.

## Objectives

* Generate a plot with the information from the Base Metal and Welding Material
* Save the final plot in png format

## Dependencies

* Matplotlib

## Usage

Just install matplotlib and run the file
